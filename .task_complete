# Task Complete: test-task

## Summary of Changes

Fixed TypeScript configuration and build issues:

1. **Fixed tsconfig.json** (tsconfig.json:14)
   - Added `"types": ["node"]` to compilerOptions to resolve TypeScript compilation errors
   - This fixed errors where `console` and `process` globals were not recognized

2. **Installed dependencies**
   - Ran `yarn install` to ensure all required packages (including @types/node) are available

3. **Verified build**
   - Successfully ran `yarn build` - compilation now completes without errors
   - Note: `yarn test` command does not exist in package.json scripts

## Status
- All required steps completed
- Build is now working correctly
- Ready to merge back to base branch: features/test
